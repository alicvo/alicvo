Hi, I'm Alice! I'm an Electrical Engineering student at San Diego State University. I am interested in control systems and electronics design. I am an Electrical/Software team member in the SDSU Mechatronics club where I get to apply my technical and communication skills. I have a wide skillset ranging from PCB design to software development. I am always eager to learn something new.
